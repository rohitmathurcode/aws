    "Suppose that we are working in Globomantics which is one of the most popular e-commerce companies. To improve user experience, you want to analyse your products based on customer reviews and change your product catalog accordingly. To achieve this, you want to build an intelligent system which will analyse the customer sentiments automatically from thousands of product reviews provided by the consumers. In short, you want to predict sentiments from the customer reviews. You'll build and train a model using recurrent neural networks to accomplish this. "

The echo could not find my NEST thermostat, nor could it find about half of my HUE lights. Once I argued and fought with Alexa for about 45 minutes, she finally started to pick up my lights and after COMLETELY re-configuring my thermostat, she could see it, but she would not work with it. Once she found all of my lights, she would turn them on or off, but would not change colors or brightness levels. I run a software company and have worked in and with computers my whole life.
